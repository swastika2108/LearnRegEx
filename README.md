# **Regex: Sequence of Characters to Define a Search Pattern**

## **Overview**
Regex, short for **Regular Expressions**, is a sequence of characters designed to define search patterns. It is a powerful tool widely used for string matching, text processing, and data validation.

## **Definition**
A Regular Expression (Regex) is a pattern composed of text characters and metacharacters. These patterns are used to perform tasks like searching, replacing, or validating strings in text data.

## **Getting Started**
To use Regex in your project, refer to the documentation of your programming language. Example for Python:
```python
import re

# Matching a pattern
pattern = r"\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}"
text = "My number is 123-45-6789."
match = re.search(pattern, text)

if match:
    print("Pattern found:", match.group())
